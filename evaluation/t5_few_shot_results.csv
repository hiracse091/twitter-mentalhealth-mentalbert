"Quawan ""Bobby"" Charles, 15, was reported missing after he was last seen on Oct. 30, leaving home without permission with a 17-year-old friend and that friend's mother. 

Law enforcement refused to act.

They deemed his death a “drowning” after his body was found in a CANE FIELD. https://t.co/kEEe6SHbWm",Anxiety,Ptsd
